# Dynamic-Artist-based-Embeddings-with-Application-to-Playlist-Generation
**AcousticRadioz**

AcousticRadioz source code - implementations of embedding methods and automatic playlist generation based on AcousticBrainz data

**Work flow for radio creation**

**1.** Run ‘Run_Data_Embedding.py’ to create the embedded data by all the four methods, while paying attention to the Artist you want to base the RED-DM on.

• Make sure you have Related_artists_df from MELON file of the designated cloud artist for the evaluation process. • If not – create it with the Jupyter notebook – ‘Melon playlists.ipynb’.

**2.** Run ‘Run_and_compare_radios.py’ while paying attention to the cloud artist you choose. • The code will take the right embedded data based on the cloud artist you choose.

**3.** Run ‘Run_visualize_radio_results.py’ and pay attention to cloud_artist in the beginning.
